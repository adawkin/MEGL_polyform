    // full DFS of the polyomino
    //
    // for the 2-d case, if I can draw a path from one end of the perimeter to another end of the
    // outer perimeter, we know that the polyomino is broken. If we can't make such a path, then we
    // are in a hole and the polyomino is sealed, or we removed a piece that did not separate the
    // polyform (for example, the end of a stick polyomino). 
    //
    // For the 3d case I'd have to make a 2d path. This is where the challenge lies vs the 2d case
    // where I have to make a 1d line. That 2d path may have to bend etc.

    // The base case happens when we pass the outer perimeter or go past the highest/lowest x/y/z
    // values of the polyform

// abandoned for now, in favor of cut validity. should be revived so we can benchmark the two
// algorithms for different cases and decide if/when to switch algorithms based on some kind of
// predictor. I realized this will execute much quicker in cases where there is an actual valid
// connection, but the same amount of time for DFS to conclude that there is no valid conncetion.
// Replaced with the cut algorithm. After a while, the optimized DFS may run quicker than cut
